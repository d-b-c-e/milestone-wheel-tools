.SYNOPSIS
    Vendors a pinned dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit release into a consumer repo,
    without overwriting anything that was edited locally.

.DESCRIPTION
    Consumers do not reference this repo's projects; they vendor BUILT artifacts
    pinned by version, so a toolkit change never reaches a game without an
    explicit, diffable bump. Copy this script into the consumer's tools/ folder
    and run it there. It downloads the release zip (or uses a local build),
    extracts the pieces the consumer needs into lib\toolkit\, and writes
    lib\toolkit\VERSION.

    LOCAL EDITS ARE NEVER CLOBBERED. After each sync the script records a
    SHA-256 for every file it wrote, in lib\toolkit\MANIFEST.txt. On the next
    sync a destination file whose hash no longer matches that record was edited
    here, so it is LEFT ALONE and reported, and the script exits non-zero. This
    matters most for profiles\force-profiles.ini: a tune someone arrived at by
    driving is not something a routine version bump should silently delete.

    Resolving one is a choice, not a merge:
      -Force        take the toolkit's copy; the local file is saved first as
                    <name>.local-<timestamp> so nothing is actually lost
      (do nothing)  keep the local file and stay behind on that one file

    Better still, do not edit a vendored file at all. Put a tune in
    force-profiles.user.ini beside the game, which nothing here ever touches,
    and promote it into the toolkit with tools\Import-Profile.ps1 when it is
    worth keeping.

    The native DLL keeps its name (WheelFfb.dll): the managed binding imports
    "WheelFfb", so a consumer that uses Dbce.Wheel.Ffb must ship it under that
    name.

.PARAMETER Version
    Release tag to vendor, e.g. v0.3.0.

.PARAMETER LocalRepo
    Use a local checkout's build output instead of a GitHub release (development).

.PARAMETER Destination
    Folder to populate. Default lib\toolkit under the consumer repo root.

.PARAMETER Parts
    Which artifact groups to copy: native (x64 WheelFfb.dll), native-x86 (the
    32-bit build, for 32-bit games), include (wheelffb.h C ABI + loader,
    forza_packet.h, force_model.h, force_profile.h), profiles
    (force-profiles.ini, which the game DEPLOYS and reads at runtime),
    powershell (DbceWheel.psm1 installer helpers), dotnet, tools, knowledge.
    Default native,dotnet. A native mod that produces force typically takes
    native-x86,include,profiles; an installer takes powershell.

.PARAMETER Force
    Overwrite locally edited files, after saving each one alongside.

    .\tools\Sync-Toolkit.ps1 -LocalRepo E:\Source\dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit -Parts profiles -Force
