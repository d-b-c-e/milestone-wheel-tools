# Forza "Data Out" packet, as emitted here

Nothing about this mod is Forza-specific; the packet is used because it is
the most widely parsed telemetry layout there is (SimHub, ShakeIt,
SimRacingStudio, most dashboards and motion software). Three variants are
selectable with `format=` in `milestone_mod.ini`.

## ⚠️ The packet length is checked exactly

The receiver validates by **total length**, and being one byte short fails
silently — no error, no data, just nothing. Measured against SimHub's
`ForzaReader` by sending each candidate size:

| bytes | result |
|-------|--------|
| 232 (sled) | rejected by the Horizon reader |
| 311 (fm7)  | rejected by the Horizon reader |
| **323**    | **rejected** — the intuitive 232 + 12 + 79 |
| **324**    | ✅ `"started receiving valid data"`, `"Game connected"` |
| 331        | accepted but immediately `Paused=True` |

Horizon is `232 sled + 12 pad + 79 dash + 1 trailing byte = 324`. Since the
toolkit encoder took over (`lib/toolkit/include/forza_packet.h`) that trailing
byte carries `'R'` (0x52) rather than zero: no Forza title reads it, and a
sentinel lets `forza_probe.py` say whose packets it is looking at when several
senders share a port. Emitting 323
made SimHub log `UDP Reader on port 8000 started receiving unprocessed data`
at packet rate — 19,880 times in one race — and never connect. If a dash stays
dead while the data looks right, check the length before anything else, and
read the receiver's own log.

The slip and suspension channels are the ones worth having for a bass shaker:
they are the game's own physics, not anything inferred from force feedback.

Derived fields exist so effect engines have something to key on; the log
line every 5 s and `tools/forza_listen.py` show the raw channels so the
scaling can be calibrated against reality.

## Receiving

SimHub: *Games → Forza Motorsport 7* (for `fm7`) or *Forza Horizon 4/5* (for
`fh4`), UDP port matching `port=`. SimHub binds the port exclusively, so run
`forza_listen.py` on `mirror_port=` when both are wanted.
